Medical image classification using convolutional neural networks is the best way to reach the goal. Convolutional neural networks provides the highest accuracy while dealing with images.
The goal is to work on labelled dataset for classifying image so that we can make the process faster and as much accurate as we can.
2-layer convolutional neural network (CNN), trained to recognise pneumonia on chest x-rays.It has achieved an good results on the relevant test set of more than 500 x-ray.It can be used for research and comparison purposes.
